title: "Resume Proofreading Checklist"
---

Stand out to employers by following this checklist to avoid common resume mistakes.

## Resume Checklist
1. Place an expected graduation date (if applicable).
2. Place clear delimiters between company and job experience.
3. Place the most recent experience at the top.
4. Make links clickable.
5. Check Linkedin/GitHub links, personal/project websites, and email addresses.
6. Put periods at the end of full sentences.
7. Excessively wordy: concision makes the readers’ lives easier.
8. Avoid acronyms unless it is widely familiar to non-technical readers (e.g., recruiters).
8. Avoid putting content in the extreme top or bottom of the page. 
   - A cheap printer might cut out the extreme top or bottom.
   - leave a ≥1/2 inch margin for safety.
9. Unnecessarily long class names. 
   - Analytic Geometry & Calculus -> Calculus. 
   - Introduction to Systems Software -> Systems Software 
   - The extra words generally do not convey enough information to justify the valuable space that the words take up.

## LaTeX-specific tidbits
1. Use \LaTeX when referencing LaTeX (for example, in a skills section) in a LaTeX resume.
2. Quotation marks
   - Use `` for a left quote
   - Use ’’ (two single-quotes) for a right quote
   - Wrong: ”using double quotes is incorrect, the left quote will not render correctly”
