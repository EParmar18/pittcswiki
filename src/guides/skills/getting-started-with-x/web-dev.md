title: "Getting Started with Web Development"

Web development touches a surprising number of software engineering projects. Even if you aren't interested in web development as a profession, having a general understanding of web development can be useful when you inevitably encounter it.

Beyond the plethora of tools and apps used every day on the web, many widely-used desktop apps are actually web applications, just running on your desktop. For example, Visual Studio Code, Discord, and Slack all use [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/), a framework for developing cross-platform desktop applications with web development toolsets.

Ultimately, the web is one of the fastest and easiest ways that your application can make its way to a user, so understanding web development can enable you to make more impactful software.

## Opinions
### Richie Goulazian
I recommend starting with the basics and working your way up to more shiny libraries and frameworks. Fancy libraries like [React](https://reactjs.org/) have very clear motivations that are easy to see once you've gained some experience writing web applications the more traditional way. 

I'd say start with raw HTML/JS, then once you're comfortable with those, pick a library like [React](https://reactjs.org/) (the one I personally use) or find another that better suits your needs.

If you feel like taking the React track, once you're comfortable with it I'd recommend looking into [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/) and [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). They're a pretty empowering combo. NextJS abstracts away a lot of boilerplate and makes writing some pretty useful web applications rather easy. NextJS saved the [VaccinatePA team](https://www.cs.pitt.edu/news/2021-cs-students-create-vaccinatepa-org) lots of hours of development time, and Vercel saved us many dollars in hosting costs (VaxPA source code can be found [here](https://github.com/VaccinatePA/Vaccinate-PA) if you're curious).
